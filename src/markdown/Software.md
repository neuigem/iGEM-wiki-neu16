## Software

#### Note

In order to be considered for the [Best Software Tool
award](http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#SpecialPrizes), you must fill out
this page.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools
to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical
need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly
useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make
the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and
honour such "nuggets" of computational work.

If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main
project, please apply for this award.

Here are a few examples from previous teams:

* [Heidelberg 2014](http://2014.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Software)
* [Aachen 2014](http://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Project/Measurement_Device#Software)
