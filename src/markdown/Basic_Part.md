#### Note

In order to be considered for the [Best New Basic Part
award](http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#SpecialPrizes), you must fill out

have made. Please see the Registry's [Help:Parts
page](http://parts.igem.org/Help:Parts#Basic_and_Composite_Parts)for more
information on part types.

A **basic part** is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into
smaller component parts.
[BBa_R0051](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051) is an example
of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.

Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick
parts. Thus, there are **many** opportunities to find new, cool, and important
genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these
functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
