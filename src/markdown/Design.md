## Design

By talking about your design work on this page, there is one medal criterion
that you can attempt to meet, and one award that you can apply for. If your team
is going for a gold medal by building a functional prototype, you should tell us
what you did on this page. If you are going for the [Applied Design
award](http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#SpecialPrizes), you should also
complete this page and tell us what you did.

#### Note

In order to be considered for the [Best Applied Design
award](http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#SpecialPrizes) and/or the [functional
prototype gold medal criterion](http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#Medals), you
must fill out this page.

This is a prize for the team that has developed a synthetic biology product to
solve a real world problem in the most elegant way. The students will have
considered how well the product addresses the problem versus other potential
solutions, how the product integrates or disrupts other products and processes,
and how its lifecycle can more broadly impact our lives and environments in
positive and negative ways.

If you are working on art and design as your main project, please join the art
and design track. If you are integrating art and design into the core of your
main project, please apply for the award by completing this page.
