## Human Practices

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they "go beyond the lab" to
imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand
issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.

Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to
explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security
issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial
for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

For more information, please see the [Practices
Hub](http://2015.igem.org/Practices_Hub).
